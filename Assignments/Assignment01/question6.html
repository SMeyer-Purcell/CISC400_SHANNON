/* Answer for question 6.

Line 1 tells you what type of script this code is.

Line 2 is letting the program know that the JavaScript code is in Strict Mode.
Strict Mode doesn't allow the programmer to use bad syntax by throwing up errors for any form of
bad syntax; for example, misspelled words. Strict Mode also prevents the programmer from
accidentally creating new global variables when they misspell a word. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp).

Line 3 is declaring a function named 'init'.

Line 4 is creating the canvas for the web browser by retrieving information that is
found under the id "webgl-canvas".

Line 5 is just a comment to let whoever is reading this code know what the
following if statement in line 6 is doing.

Line 6 is an if statement. It's telling the program to check to see if there is a canvas created.

Line 7 creates an error message that can be viewed in the console section of your web browser.
An error message is displayed, letting the user know that the program was unable to find the
HTML5 canvas on their web browser.

Line 8 is a return statement.
A return statement lets the program know to stop executing the if statement.
In most cases, a return statement will return a value to the function it is inside of,
but there is no variable next to the return statement, so no value is being returned to
the init() function regarding the if statement.

Line 9 is just a closing bracket for the if statement.

Line 10 is using an HTML5 DOM method (https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp) to retrieve rendering context for the canvas
before it can draw the object onto the canvas.
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage#:~:text=The%20element%20has%20a,var%20canvas%20%3D%20document.).
The information about the object that is passed as the parameter for the canvas.getContext() method
is then saved as the variable 'gl'.

Line 11 is a comment that lets whoever is reading the code that the following section of code is
being used to make sure that there is context that can be drawn onto the canvas.

Line 12 creates a message using the context information that was stored in variable 'gl'.

Lines 13 and 14 are messages that will be displayed to the user on their web browser based
on what condition the variable 'gl' meets.
Line 13 uses the '?' condition variable to indicate that if the condition is met, the program
will run the message 'Hooray! You got a WebGL2 context'.
Line 14 uses the ':' condition variable to indicate that if the condition is not met,
the program will run the message 'Sorry! WebGL is not available'.

Line 15 creates an alert message that will appear on the users web browser that will
display the message that matches the correct condition variable.
If the condition is met, the alert will display the 'Hooray' message.
If the condition is not met, the alert will display the 'Sorry' message.

Line 16 is a closing bracket to close the init() function.

Line 17 is a comment that lets wheover is reading the code know that
'function init()' should be called once the window has loaded.

Line 18 uses the HTML DOM onload event (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onload.asp),
which will call the function 'init' once the web browser has been opened.

Line 19 is the closing tag for JavaScript.
